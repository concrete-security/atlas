# RA-TLS Toolkit

Portable Remote Attestation for the modern web. This toolkit delivers verified TLS connections to TEEs from browsers (via WASM), Node.js, and Python without relying on platform-native attestation stacks.

---

# 1. Project Overview & Quickstart

## Key Features
- Browser-first verification: full attestation performed inside WASM.
- Transport agnostic: direct TCP for Node/Python, WebSocket/WebTransport tunnel for browsers.
- Configurable policy engine: enforce TCB levels, measurements, advisory IDs.
- Supported TEEs: Intel TDX today; AMD SEV-SNP planned.

## Quickstart Demo

**Prerequisites**
- Rust (stable toolchain)
- `wasm-pack` (`cargo install wasm-pack`)
- Python 3 (serving static assets)
- LLVM/Clang with `wasm32` support

**Run the live demo**
```bash
make demo
```
1. Visit `http://localhost:8080/web-check/`.
2. Confirm the pre-filled target (sample TDX endpoint).
3. Click **Run attestation check**.
4. The browser opens a WebSocket to the proxy, tunnels TLS to the TEE, requests a quote, and verifies it locally.

# 2. Architecture & Data Flow

Browsers lack raw TCP sockets and attestation primitives. The toolkit uses a **Tunnel-and-Verify** approach to work around both limitations.

### Data Path

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Browser (WASM)] -- WebSocket (Encrypted TLS) --> B[Local Proxy]
    B -- Raw TCP (Still Encrypted) --> C[TEE Server]

    subgraph "Browser Context"
        A
        D[Core Verifier]
    end

    subgraph "Untrusted Host"
        B
    end

    subgraph "Trusted Enclave"
        C
    end
```

1. **Tunnel:** Browser connects to the proxy via WebSocket.
2. **Forward:** Proxy opens TCP to the target and blindly forwards bytes; TLS stays end-to-end.
3. **Handshake:** WASM client completes TLS 1.3 over the tunnel.
4. **Quote Fetch:** Client issues an HTTP request inside the tunnel to fetch the hardware quote.
5. **Verification:** `ratls-core` validates the quote against the TLS certificate and user policy.

# 3. Component Guide

## `core/`
- `ratls_connect`: Handshake + verification over a generic async byte stream.
- `PromiscuousVerifier`: Accepts any X.509 initially, captures leaf cert for post-handshake validation.
- `TdxTcbPolicy`: Encodes acceptable TDX TCB levels and measurements.

## `wasm/`
- `WasmWsStream`: Wraps browser `WebSocket` into `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` for `rustls`.
- `run_attestation_check(...)`: Diagnostics helper.
- `httpRequest(...)`: HTTP/1.1 over RA-TLS with streaming bodies.
- `ratls-fetch.js`: Fetch-compatible shim you can hand to AI SDKs for chat streaming.
- `wasm/examples/ai-sdk-openai-demo.mjs`: Simple streaming test against `vllm.concrete-security.com` using `@ai-sdk/openai` + the RA-TLS fetch (requires `@ai-sdk/openai`, `ai`, `ws`, and `zod@^4`).

Example:
```javascript
import init, { httpRequest } from "ratls-wasm";
import { createRatlsFetch } from "ratls-wasm/ratls-fetch.js";

await init();

const ratlsResponse = await httpRequest(
  "ws://localhost:9000?target=secure-enclave.com:443",
  "secure-enclave.com",
  "secure-enclave.com",
  "GET",
  "/health",
  [],
  undefined
);
// Stream the body with await ratlsResponse.readChunk() until empty
// ratlsResponse.attestation() returns the attestation result

const ratlsFetch = createRatlsFetch({
  proxyUrl: "ws://localhost:9000",
  targetHost: "secure-enclave.com:443",
});
// pass ratlsFetch where a standard fetch is expected
```

## `proxy/`
- Listens on WebSocket/WebTransport.
- Reads `?target=host:port`.
- Opens TCP and shuttles bytes bi-directionally.
- Must enforce allowlists/ACLs in production to guard against SSRF.
- Configuration is driven via environment variables (see `proxy/README.md` for detail):
  - `RATLS_PROXY_LISTEN` (default `127.0.0.1:9000`)
  - `RATLS_PROXY_TARGET` (default `127.0.0.1:8443`)
  - `RATLS_PROXY_ALLOWLIST` (required, comma-separated host:port list; the proxy refuses to start when empty). Set this to cover both the default target and any values you expect to pass via `?target=...`.
- Always run the proxy with an allowlist that matches the enclave endpoints you plan to reach; otherwise requests will be rejected before the TLS tunnel is established.

## Node bindings (direct TCP)
- `node/` contains the napi-rs binding that talks RA-TLS over TCP without the WebSocket proxy.
- Two public entry points exist today: `http_request(...)` (buffered body) and `http_stream_request(...)` (true streaming) along with the `createRatlsFetch` shim that attaches attestation to `response.ratlsAttestation` and an `x-ratls-attestation` header.
- Build and exercise the binding locally:
  ```bash
  rustup override set 1.88.0   # or newer toolchain
  cargo build -p ratls-node --release
  pnpm add -D @ai-sdk/openai ai ws zod@^4
  node node/examples/ai-sdk-openai-demo.mjs "Hello from RA-TLS"
  ```
- When the native module is built, `node/index.js` loads `target/release/ratls_node.node` automatically (override via `RATLS_NODE_BINARY` if you stash the binary elsewhere). See `node/README.md` for API docs and the AI SDK integration walkthrough.

## Additional Directories
- `node/`: NAPI bindings that talk TCP directly with optional tunnel fallback.
- `python/`: PyO3 bindings with async helpers.
- `server-examples/`: Reference RA-TLS servers for TDX/SNP (coming soon).
- `docs/`: Design notes, specs, and task tracking.

## Binding status
- WASM: functional; provides `RatlsClient`, `httpRequest`, and the fetch shim used by the browser demo plus `wasm/examples/ai-sdk-openai-demo.mjs`.
- Node: functional; direct TCP plus fetch shim, see section above.
- Python: scaffolding in progress (`python/README.md`) with planned async API parity once the core pieces stabilize.

# 4. Policy Configuration

Policies describe what constitutes an acceptable attestation. The `ratls-core` API (and each binding) consumes a `Policy` struct with the following shape:

```json
{
  "tee_type": "Tdx",
  "allowed_tdx_status": ["UpToDate", "SWHardeningNeeded"],
  "minimum_tcb": {
    "svn": 3,
    "mrseam": "hex bytes",
    "mrtd": "hex bytes"
  },
  "advisories_blocklist": ["INTEL-SA-00999"],
  "allow_debug": false,
  "expected_measurements": [
    {
      "rtmr_index": 3,
      "sha256": "hex bytes for TLS key binding event"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tee_type` | Chooses the verifier backend (`Tdx`, `Snp`, etc.). |
| `allowed_tdx_status` | Acceptable `TD_REPORT.STATUS` strings (e.g., `UpToDate`). |
| `minimum_tcb` | Lower bounds for SVN plus MRSEAM/MRTD digests to block downgraded builds. |
| `advisories_blocklist` | Rejects quotes referencing these advisory IDs. |
| `allow_debug` | Permits debug TEEs when `true` (default `false`). |
| `expected_measurements` | Optional event/measurement checks, including TLS key hash binding. |

Verification flow with a policy:
1. Confirm the quote matches `tee_type`.
2. Ensure the reported status is in `allowed_tdx_status`.
3. Compare SVN and measurement digests to `minimum_tcb`.
4. Verify no blocked advisories are reported.
5. Enforce `allow_debug`.
6. Recalculate listed measurements (e.g., TLS pubkey hash in RTMR3) and compare to `expected_measurements`.

# 5. Protocol Specification

### Step 1: TLS Handshake
- TLS 1.3 with a promiscuous verifier. The certificate is accepted temporarily and recorded.

### Step 2: Quote Retrieval
Client sends an HTTP POST over the established TLS channel:
```http
POST /tdx_quote HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "report_data": "<hex_nonce>"
}
```

Server responds:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "quote": {
    "quote": "<hex_tdx_quote>",
    "event_log": [...]
  },
  "collateral": { ... }
}
```

### Step 3: Verification
1. Validate the quote signature using Intel PCCS collateral (`dcap-qvl` flow).
2. Ensure `report_data` equals the client nonce (freshness).
3. Recompute RTMR3 by replaying every event log entry in order and ensure the final digest matches the quote.
4. During that replay, locate the TLS key binding event (contains the certificate pubkey hash) to prove the attested workload owns the negotiated TLS key.

# Development Reference

## Directory Structure
- `core/`: Verification + policy.
- `wasm/`: Browser bindings.
- `proxy/`: Tunnel service.
- `server-examples/`: Forthcoming reference TEEs.

## Build Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `make test` | Run Rust unit tests for core and proxy. |
| `make test-node` | Build `ratls-node`, install AI SDK deps via pnpm, and run the streaming smoke test against `vllm.concrete-security.com`. |
| `make test-wasm` | Check build for the `wasm32` target. |
| `make build-wasm` | Compile the WASM package into `pkg/`. |
| `make proxy` | Run the proxy server standalone. |
| `make web-check` | Serve the static WASM test harness. |
| `make demo` | Build WASM and run proxy + web harness together. |

Set `RUN_WASM_AI_SDK=1` when invoking `make test-wasm` to build the bindings and launch the WASM AI SDK smoke test (requires the proxy to be running in another shell).

## Troubleshooting WASM Builds
- Errors like `rust-lld: error: unknown file type` typically mean LLVM/Clang lacks `wasm32` support.
- Run `./setup-wasm-toolchain.sh` on macOS to install a compatible LLVM via Homebrew, then re-run the build.
